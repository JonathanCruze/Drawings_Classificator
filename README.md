# Pixelated Handmade Drawings Classifier

Pixelated Handmade Drawings Classifier is a repository that contains a classifier designed to classify different types of pixelated drawings created by hand. It is based on a similar approach to MNIST but utilizes a dataset specifically crafted for this project.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the classifier has been meticulously curated. It is included in the `Train` and `Test` folders within this repository. Each folder consists of subfolders representing each class of drawings, such as: *House, Human, Letter J, Letter N, Letter M, Heart, etc.* Each class subfolder contains multiple images of the corresponding type of drawing.

Please note that this repository was primarily created for testing purposes, and certain aspects might not be refined. The main objective was to develop a functional whiteboard and demonstrate the model predictive capabilities based on the images drawn by the user.

## Google Colaboratory Notebook

To explore the functionality of the classifier and gain hands-on experience, you can access bia this [Google Colaboratory Notebook Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xgEADBafrzOMSwvCQqMF-iS-mI54hWad?usp=sharing). The notebook provides comprehensive guidance, including all the necessary data files pulled directly from this repository.

Feel free to delve into the notebook and leverage it to understand and experiment with the Pixelated Handmade Drawings Classifier.
